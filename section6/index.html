      These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, 
      to boldly go where no one has gone before. 
      We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. 
      Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

      I have reset the sensors to scan for frequencies outside the usual range. By emitting harmonic vibrations to shatter the lattices. 
      We will monitor and adjust the frequency of the resonators. He has this ability of instantly interpreting and extrapolating any verbal communication he hears. 
      It may be due to the envelope over the structure, causing hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. 
      I'm comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers.

      Resistance is futile.
